# Acknowledgements

The scenes created for this project would not have been possible without a
number of free and personal-use-only assets found online. This section attempts
to cite each external OBJ file, texture map, and normal map used throughout this
project.

Each path listed below is relative to the root directory of the project. To help
reduce the size and complexity of this list, the `*` character has been used to
indicate a "wildcard" path. That will match multiple files with behaviour
similar to what you would expect from the the `ls` command.

The following models and images were created by me for the purposes of this
project:

* `assets/castle*.obj`
* `assets/computer*.obj`
* `assets/cpu_cubemap.png`
* `assets/flat_rock.obj`
* `assets/smooth_rock.obj`
* `assets/four-shapes.png`
* `assets/monkey.obj` - From Blender, exported by me
* `assets/monkey_torso.obj`
* `assets/text_monkey.3d.obj`
* `assets/prim_castle_door.obj`
* `assets/puppet_castle_*_tower.obj`
* `assets/robot-alarm-clock/robot_*.obj`
* `assets/tog_grass.obj`
* `assets/tog_puppet.obj`
* `assets/tog_underwater_land.obj`

Several of these textures were turned into cubemaps using an online
[panorama to cubemap tool](http://gonchar.me/panorama/).
